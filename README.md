# Excursion

## Description

A web page which advertises a product called “Excursion.” 
The web page advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, 
so it use video and landscape imagery to set the scene. A landing page is a vital tool in marketing a product these days, 
and the goal is to entice potential customers into using the product.

I used it to practice using toolset including HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub.
